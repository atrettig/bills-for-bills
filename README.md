# Bills for Bills
### Description
This project aims to expose the unethical practices of poloticians in the open financial markets through visualization and deep analysis of their personal financial transactions. Poloticians have been allowed to trade equities, bonds, public companies, and indicies while maintaining the power to vote on ledgislation that may direcly effect the preformance of these underlyings. Through the use of visualization, we will show why this should not be allowed and the obvious conflict of interest that exists.
